# ‚öõÔ∏è Quantum Computings Labs

This repository contains implementations of seven Quantum Computing Laboratory exercises developed as part of my University of Chicago‚Äôs online Quantum Computing program.
The focus of these labs is on algorithmic quantum computing and quantum circuits experimentation. Each lab was implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and frameworks such as Qiskit and NumPy.

üìö Topics Covered
- Quantum Physics Foundations : Principles behind quantum computer hardware and system design.
- Quantum Logic Gates & Circuits : Implementation of single- and multi-qubit gates such as Hadamard, Pauli-X/Y/Z, and CNOT, exploring their roles in quantum algorithm design.
- Qubit States & Measurements : Understanding superposition, entanglement, and quantum state evolution, and the probabilistic nature of measurement outcomes.
- Quantum Noise & Decoherence : Modeling imperfections and error sources.
- Mathematical Frameworks for Quantum Physics : Including concepts like linear algebra, complex vector spaces, tensor products, and transformations such as the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).

‚öôÔ∏è Note: Some libraries used are now deprecated
