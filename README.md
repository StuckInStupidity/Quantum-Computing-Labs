These codes were implemented for 7 Quantum Computing Laboratories proposed by the University of Chicago as part of an online program. 
Lessons were given at the start, they encompassed quantum physics principles for the hardware and conception of quantum computers such as Quantum Logic Gates & Circuits, 
qubit states & measurements, as well as Quantum Noises and a great deal of mathematics alongside (ex: Quantum Fourier Series...) 
accompanied with the algorithmic of quantum computers. After enough understanding on these matters, we had a try at these hands-on laboratories.
